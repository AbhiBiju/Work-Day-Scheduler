# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

In this challenge, I made a Work Day Scheduler that utilizes jQuery, Local Storage and Moment.js in order to dynamically create tasks based on an Hourly schedule and keep the tasks in local storage for later reference.

The deployed application can be found at: [abhibiju.github.io/work-day-scheduler](https://abhibiju.github.io/work-day-scheduler)

Here is what the website currently looks like:
